# Singleton Pattern Demo

## Overview
This project is a **professional C# console application** demonstrating the **Singleton Design Pattern**, a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only **one instance** and provides a global point of access to it, which is useful in scenarios where centralized control of resources is needed.

This project is part of my programming portfolio and showcases my understanding of **design patterns, C# programming, and clean code principles**.

## Features
- Implements the Singleton Pattern to control class instantiation.
- Console-based demonstration for easy testing and understanding.
- Clear and well-documented C# code adhering to object-oriented principles.
- Designed with maintainability and scalability in mind.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **C# Programming:** Writing structured, maintainable, and efficient code.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Encapsulation, class control, and instance management.
- **Design Patterns:** Singleton Pattern implementation and practical usage.
- **Portfolio-Ready Code:** Clear naming conventions, comments, and professional structure.
